# Template Installation

If you want to work offline with a code editor, you must install the static site generator (SSG) to your local machine. This is optional, as you can also work wholly online, or offline with a text editor and command line or git client. See [**Content Creation**](organisation/content-creation.md) for details.

### GDS Tech Docs Template
To install the Technical Documents Template (TDT), see the Government Digital Services' (GDS)  [installation documentation here](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/).

The GDS TDT is used with static site generator Middleman. To install Middleman, see [**SSG installation**](/installation/install-ssg.md) for details.

### Docusaurus Template

The Docusaurus SSG includes an integral template, and nothing further needs to be installed.

MDTP will make customisations.
